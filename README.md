FALSE NEWS DETECTION USING TFIDF AND LSTM(RNN)
LSTM stands for long short term memory
This code may not superseed other techniques that are currently in the field of Machine learning, but it is provided to help in the understanding of such a system.\n
...............................................................
The steps included:
1.) Cleaning up of data
2.) Lemmetization
3.) Tfidf vectorization which outputs sparse matrix 
4.) Padding to make sure the data given can be used as input in the RNN, technique used was truncatedSVD
5.) Lstm, a bidirectional LSTM, Droput Layers could have been used to increase accuracy

This project was undertaken on Google Colab for around 6 months
